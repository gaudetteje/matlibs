These MATLAB libraries are organized into a set of numerous submodules, grouped into subdirectories.  Each submodule is by itself another git repository, tracked by this project.

To clone the repository with all submodules, use the following commands:
```
git clone git://github.com/gaudetteje/matlibs.git
cd matlibs
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
